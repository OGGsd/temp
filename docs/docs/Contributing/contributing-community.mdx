There are several ways you can interact with the AxieStudio community and learn more about the AxieStudio codebase.



## Star AxieStudio on GitHub

If you like AxieStudio, you can star the [AxieStudio GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiestudio/axiestudio).
Stars help other users find AxieStudio more easily, and quickly understand that other users have found it useful.

Because AxieStudio is open-source, the more visible the repository is, the more likely the codebase is to attract [contributors](/contributing-how-to-contribute).

## Watch the GitHub repository

You can watch the [AxieStudio GitHub repository](https://github.com/axiestudio/axiestudio) to get notified about new releases and other repository activity.

To get release notifications only, select **Releases only**.

If you select **Watching**, you will receive notifications about new releases as well as issues, discussions, and pull requests, if you are interested in that activity.
For information about customizing repository notifications, see the [GitHub documentation on repository subscriptions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions).
