import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

You can use the AxieStudio API for programmatic interactions with AxieStudio, such as the following:

* Create and edit flows, including file management for flows.
* Develop applications that use your flows.
* Develop custom components.
* Build AxieStudio as a dependency of a larger application, codebase, or service.
* Contribute to the overall AxieStudio codebase.

To view and test all available endpoints, you can access the AxieStudio API's OpenAPI specification at your AxieStudio deployment's `/docs` endpoint, such as `http://localhost:7860/docs`.

:::tip Try it
For an example of the AxieStudio API in a script, see the [AxieStudio quickstart](/get-started-quickstart).

The quickstart demonstrates how to get automatically generated code snippets for your flows, use a script to run a flow, and extract data from the Langfow API response.

## Form AxieStudio API requests

While individual options vary by endpoint, all AxieStudio API requests share some commonalities, like a URL, method, parameters, and authentication.

As an example of a AxieStudio API request, the following curl command calls the `/v1/run` endpoint, and it passes a runtime override (`tweaks`) to the flow's **Chat Output** component:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "$AxieStudio_SERVER_URL/api/v1/run/$FLOW_ID?stream=false" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $AxieStudio_API_KEY" \
  --data '{
  "input_value": "hello world!",
  "output_type": "chat",
  "input_type": "chat",
  "tweaks": {
    "ChatOutput-6zcZt": {
      "should_store_message": true
    }
  }
}'
```

### Base URL

By default, local deployments serve the AxieStudio API at `http://localhost:7860/api`.

Remotely hosted AxieStudio deployments are available at the domain set by the hosting service, such as `http://IP_OR_DNS/api` or `http://IP_OR_DNS:AxieStudio_PORT/api`.

You can configure the AxieStudio port number in the `AxieStudio_PORT` [environment variable](/environment-variables).

* `https://UUID.ngrok.app/api`
* `http://IP_OR_DNS/api`
* `http://IP_OR_DNS:AxieStudio_PORT/api`

### Authentication

In AxieStudio versions 1.5 and later, most API endpoints require authentication with a AxieStudio API key in either an `x-api-key` header or query parameter.
For more information, see [API keys and authentication](/api-keys-and-authentication).

As with any API, follow industry best practices for storing and referencing sensitive credentials.
For example, you can [set environment variables](#set-environment-variables) for your API keys, and then reference those environment variables in your API requests.

### Methods, paths, and parameters

AxieStudio API requests use various methods, paths, path parameters, query parameters, and body parameters.
The specific requirements and options depend on the endpoint that you want to call.

For example, to create a flow, you pass a JSON-formatted flow definition to `POST /v1/flows`.
Then, to run your flow, you call `POST /v1/run/$FLOW_ID` with optional run parameters in the request body.

### API versions

The AxieStudio API serves `/v1` and `/v2` endpoints.

Some endpoints only exist under a single version and some exist under both the `/v1` and `/v2` versions.

If a request fails or has an unexpected result, make sure your endpoint path has the correct version.

## Set environment variables

You can store commonly used values in environment variables to facilitate reuse, simplify token rotation, and securely reference sensitive values.

You can use any method you prefer to set environment variables, such as `export`, `.env`, `zshrc`, or `.curlrc`.
Then, reference those environment variables in your API requests.
For example:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export AxieStudio_API_KEY="sk..."
export AxieStudio_SERVER_URL="https://localhost:7860"
export FLOW_ID="359cd752-07ea-46f2-9d3b-a4407ef618da"
export PROJECT_ID="1415de42-8f01-4f36-bf34-539f23e47466"
export AxieStudio_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Use environment variables in API requests
curl --request POST \
  --url "$AxieStudio_SERVER_URL/api/v1/run/$FLOW_ID$?stream=false" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $AxieStudio_API_KEY" \
  --data '{
  "input_value": "hello world!",
  "output_type": "chat",
  "input_type": "chat",
  "tweaks": {
    "ChatOutput-6zcZt": {
      "should_store_message": true
    }
  }
}'
```

Commonly used values in AxieStudio API requests include your [AxieStudio server URL](#base-url), [AxieStudio API keys](#authentication), flow IDs, and [project IDs](/api-projects#read-projects).

You can retrieve flow IDs from the [**API access** pane](/concepts-publish#api-access), in a flow's URL, and with [`GET /flows`](/api-flows#read-flows).

## Try some AxieStudio API requests

Once you have your AxieStudio server URL, try calling these endpoints that return AxieStudio metadata.

### Get version

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "$AxieStudio_SERVER_URL/api/v1/version" \
  -H "accept: application/json"
  -H "x-api-key: $AxieStudio_API_KEY"
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```text
{
    "version": "1.1.1",
    "main_version": "1.1.1",
    "package": "AxieStudio"

```

</details>

### Get configuration

Returns configuration details for your AxieStudio deployment:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "$AxieStudio_SERVER_URL/api/v1/config" \
  -H "accept: application/json"
  -H "x-api-key: $AxieStudio_API_KEY"
```

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```json

curl -X GET \
  "$AxieStudio_SERVER_URL/api/v1/all" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $AxieStudio_API_KEY"
```

## Available endpoints

Because you can run AxieStudio as either an IDE (frontend and backend) or a runtime (headless, backend-only), it serves endpoints that support frontend and backend operations.
Many endpoints are for orchestration between the frontend and backend, reading and writing to the AxieStudio database, or enabling frontend functionality, like the **Playground**.
Unless you are contributing to the AxieStudio codebase, you won't directly call most of the AxieStudio endpoints.

For application development, the most commonly used endpoints are the `/run` and `/webhook` [flow trigger endpoints](/api-flows-run).
For some use cases, you might use some other endpoints, such as the `/files` endpoints to use files in flows.

To help you explore the available endpoints, the following lists are sorted by primary use case, although some endpoints might support multiple use cases.
