AxieStudio provides optional dependency groups and support for custom dependencies to extend AxieStudio functionality. This guide covers how to add dependencies for AxieStudio OSS installations.

The AxieStudio codebase uses two `pyproject.toml` files to manage dependencies, with one for `base` and one for `main`:

* The `main` package is managed by the root level `pyproject.toml`, and it includes end-user features and main application code, such as Langchain and OpenAI.
* The `base` package is managed at `src/backend/base/pyproject.toml`, and it includes core infrastructure, such as the FastAPI web framework.



## Install custom dependencies in AxieStudio OSS

To install your own custom dependencies in your AxieStudio environment, add them with your package manager.

If you're working within a cloned AxieStudio repository, add dependencies with `uv add` because there is already a `pyproject.toml` file for uv to reference:

```bash
uv add DEPENDENCY
```

### Install optional dependency groups

AxieStudio OSS provides optional dependency groups that extend its functionality.

These dependencies are listed in the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/AxieStudio-ai/AxieStudio/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L194) file under `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

Install dependency groups using pip's `[extras]` syntax. For example, to install AxieStudio with the `postgresql` dependency group, enter the following command:

```bash
uv pip install "AxieStudio[postgresql]"
```

To install multiple extras, use commas to separate each dependency group:

```bash
uv pip install "AxieStudio[local,postgresql]"
```

### Use a virtual environment to test custom dependencies

When testing locally, use a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies and prevent conflicts with other Python projects.

For example, if you want to experiment with `matplotlib` with AxieStudio:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv YOUR_AxieStudio_VENV
source YOUR_AxieStudio_VENV/bin/activate

# Install AxieStudio and your additional dependency
uv pip install AxieStudio matplotlib
```

If you're working within a cloned AxieStudio repository, add dependencies with `uv add` to reference the existing `pyproject.toml` files:

```bash
uv add matplotlib
```

The `uv add` commands automatically update the `uv.lock` file in the appropriate location.

## Add dependencies to the AxieStudio codebase

When contributing to the AxieStudio codebase, you might need to add dependencies to AxieStudio.

AxieStudio uses a workspace with two packages, each with different types of dependencies.

To add a dependency to the `main` package, run `uv add DEPENDENCY` from the project root.
For example:

```bash
uv add matplotlib
```

Dependencies can be added to the `main` package as regular dependencies at `[project.dependencies]` or optional dependencies at `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

To add a dependency to the `base` package, navigate to `src/backend/base` and run:
```bash
cd src/backend/base && uv add DEPENDENCY
```

To add a development dependency for testing, linting, or debugging, navigate to `src/backend/base` and run:
```bash
cd src/backend/base && uv add --group dev DEPENDENCY
```

Dependencies can be added to the `base` package as regular dependencies at `[project.dependencies]`, development dependencies at `[dependency-groups.dev]`, or optional dependencies at `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

You can optionally use `make add` instead of `uv add`:

```bash
# Equivalent to: uv add matplotlib
make add main="matplotlib"

# Equivalent to: cd src/backend/base && uv add --group dev matplotlib
make add devel="matplotlib"

# Equivalent to: cd src/backend/base && uv add matplotlib
make add base="matplotlib"
```

Alternatively, you can add these dependencies manually to the appropriate `pyproject.toml` file:

```
[project]
dependencies = [
    "matplotlib>=3.8.0"
]
```

Or as an optional dependency in the main package:

```
[project.optional-dependencies]
plotting = [
    "matplotlib>=3.8.0",
]
```

Or as a development dependency in the base package:

```
[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "matplotlib>=3.8.0",
]
```
